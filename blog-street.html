                        The block of Jamestown was where Jerome grew up. This was in the hood as the kids called it. A gang ran street also known as the Vagos crew. Me and Andre at the age of 13 had to hide out in the compound playing poker and card games for 5 years until we were 18
                        which made not only myself and Andre very mad. Because we couldn't help our fellow boys out when the shoot outs happend. Now me and Andre knew how to use a firearm did so ever since we were 11. During 1 afternoon on the 10 of June 2008 Andre went for a drive. But after
                        about 6 hours of no answers and ignorning my messages I presumed he died, or is off the radar. Andre was turing the corner of borderline insanity. From the gunshots and nightmares, this wasn't a suprise as he has ran before. But this time was different. I could tell he wasn't coming home.
                        I waited for weeks to which he never arrived. Thus I came to the conclusion he had passed. 
                      </p>
                      <p class="mb-30">
                        2014 Comes around, I was informed by a Ex Ballas memeber who had come to us, who still had contact with his mate still in Ballas. That Andre joined their gang, Which is odd because he had major beef with them owing them money. So i just assumed he joined and is paying off his debt by doing their
                        dirty work. This was no issue as well he had abandoned us at the Vagos for the Ballas which was a shit gang, im gonna put that on the record. Filled with hot shot 19 year olds and ran by a 21 year old. Whom watched like 4 gang movies between them and made a gang. Which respect to them, holding fourm isn't as easy and 1+1.
                        But non the less they managed.

                        Fast foward to January 2nd, 2016. I met Tanisha a 20 year old, now this was something else. There was a connection so far beyond my beliefs. They where friends for a while until. 
                        I had to ask a friend of myn what is happening. She explained how this person and you where way to comfortable with each other. Something a good friendship has, but this spiked my intrest. I was curious out of all the people on the streets she chose me, why? My charm or what not because well lets be real
                        Jerome Neil isn't the goodest lookin gangsta about. But still was something else was going on here, seeing that smile everytime we saw each other, me living life to the fullest, making her laugh. 
                      </p>
                      <p> Lets cut to January 13th, I asked Tanisha out, thus sparking this relationship. She moved in with me, making her younger sister Kay come live with us in the spare bedroom. Two weeks later i was cooking some beans for mea and the rest of my crew whom were playing cards on a barrel in the parking lot.</p>
                      <p> I have this recollection like it was yesterday, still to this day. But the little egg timer went off, meaning the beans were done. I start putting them into bowls for the lads outside to enjoy, Tanisha was watching The Simpsons on the couch, Kay was taking Cookie for a walk, like she always did at this time.
                        Then after i put the beans into the 3rd bowl, i heard a shot go off, i just presumed it was Darrel shooting to prove he won or something, but then more went off, tires were screaching, what sounded like 3-4 cars barreling down the street, with automatic gun fire. Tirese was the only one on the block that day with the automatic weapon.
                        But I can identify how he shoots, I knew it was a drive by within 3 seconds of shots going off. I reached for my glock but by the time i got out the door, they turned the corner, i managed to hit the tailight of the last car, yellow i think it was, or green. i can't remeber but, all i can remeber is looking out my door, seeing my crew on 
                        the floor. All of them bleeding out, I took a few seconds before looking around, then i looked across the street. There she was on the floor surronded by blood and a singular scream let out from her, Kay was bleeding out on the street. I've never ran so fast in my life, I was holding her saying your not gonna die, your not gon-- d--. She was gone. </p>
                    <blockquote> At 5:32pm on January 27th 2016, Kay Takialai was caught in the gangs crossfire, causing her to wistand 12 Gun shot wounds to the chest and back. Kay had passed at the age of 14.</blockquote>
