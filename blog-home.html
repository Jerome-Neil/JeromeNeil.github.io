                      <p class="mb-30"> Tomorrow is never promised, this was a quote Jerome was living by every single day of his life.</p>
                      <p class="mb-30">After being born Jerome was neglected and abused by his mothers boyfriends, merely because of his colour and how his brothers and sisters where all white, meanwhile Jerome was black. Due to his "father". By the age of 3 Jerome had been beaten more then 100x by different boyfriends. Did Jerome's mother know? No she didn't because if Jerome had ever speaken of the beatings, he will get beat more with an object instead of their fists. Jerome had to play it off as a playground accident every time.</p>

                      <blockquote> Joshua 1:9 - Be strong and courageous; do not be frightened or dismayed, for the Lord your God is with you wherever you go.</blockquote>
                      
                      <p class="mb-30">Joshua 1:9 The Bible quote Jerome was read to at the age of 3 in his local church. This changed Jerome, after he heard this, he packed his minimal belogings, wrote Darlene a note and left it under her pillow, and headed for the street. Now Jerome watched alot of Sex In The City. So he knew how to hail a cab. So Jerome did just that and said JFK please, Some how this 3 year old knew what JFK was and how to talk to a stranger, this was a major leap for little Jerome as he grew up in an abusive household for his whole life.</p>
                      <p class="mb-30"> Once Jerome had arrived at JFK, the kid was so lost he had no idea how to do anything, it was walking for the first time again. Eventually a TSA officer had spotted the poor little me, I explained my situation, I was a kid who's parents forgot him and i needed to go to Sydney, where they were going. Now imma be straight here i literally pointed at the 3rd flight that departed 5 minutes ago, the TSA officer then put 2 and 2 together. But as we all know i was fleeing. I wrote a note for god sakes fool. Anyways, I was headed for a random country i never heard off. I was taken care of on the plane. Now once i arrived in Sydney, I ran, no like i ran, ever seen usain bolt, yeah imagine him but fatter and slower, I didn't know where i was going i was just running. </p>
                      
                     
                      <p class="mb-30">Now I found a foster faimly, in Sydney purely becuase of the IRS finding me in the airport toilets. Now this family lived in the more poor part of Sydney the hood as the kids used to say. Im gonna say they were 20-25year old couple, junkies in it for the money. Whom also had a black son, Andres he said his name was. Fast foward it's 1999 me and Andres where at the local park on the swings doing what normal 6 year olds would be doing, this park was 2 blocks from our crib. When at around 4:32pm a rain of gunshots went off, we where trained to hide during situations like this. Kids were never shot anyways but still. 2 hours later, we came out when all was silent. Officers were waiting for us outside the bush, 5 words "Are You jerome and Andres?" Then his partner spoke "Were sorry but their gone" Now me and Andres were confused, who? our parents? "Yes" i let out and emotional "THEY NEVER LOVED US, THEY LOVED THE NEEDLES FROM DAVE MORE THEN THEY LOVED US!" </p>
                      <blockquote>The street rules, yes the street has rules,  Never. Ever, shoot a kid or put one in danger.</blockquote>
                      <p>By the end of the night, me and Andres where on the streets, 2 six year olds, roaming the hood at 2am, not safe. When Dom picked us up and carried us to his house, we were kicking screaming and biting, but Dom had a plan for us. Now Dom was a 18 year old who worked the local 7/12. He literally got us into primary school, How i have no idea. By the time we graduated primary school, Dom paid for our highschooling. Now me and Andres where closer then Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston. Now me and Andres saw ourselves as the only 2 black kids in that school, resulting in bullying, and Eventually leading to a fight and we got expelled. We're waiting in the office. When the office lady says "are you two waiting for Dom?" We replied yeah gansta. She said "How do i put this, well Dom was involved in a car jacking, resulting in him getting shot and left to bleed out, the officers couldn't save him" This sent me and Andres into shambles, the only man who believed in us, gave us hope is gone. We took his house and avoided payments until we got jobs at the 7/12.</p>
